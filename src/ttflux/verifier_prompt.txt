2. **Creativity and Originality** (1-10): Does the image show creative interpretation while staying true to the prompt? Is there artistic merit?

3. **Visual Quality and Realism** (1-10): Assess the technical quality - resolution, clarity, lighting, composition, and photorealism (if applicable).

4. **Consistency and Cohesion** (1-10): Are all elements in the image consistent in style, lighting, and scale? Does the image feel unified?

5. **Emotional or Thematic Resonance** (1-10): Does the image evoke the intended mood or theme? Does it tell a story?

6. **Overall Score** (1-10): A holistic assessment considering all above factors.
